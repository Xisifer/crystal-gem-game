// When the game is started, several things need to happen:
//    1. A random number is generated as the Target Score (between 19 - 120)


    // 2. This random number is shown to the player
    // 3. Random Value is chosen for each gem and assigned to that button (between 1 - 12)
        // a. Garnet
        // b. Amethyst
        // c. Pearl
        // d. Diamond
    // 4. The number of Games Won is set
    // 5. The number of Games Lost is set

    // When the user clicks on a gem, several things happen:
        // 1. That gem's value is added to the Current Score
        // 2. The Current Score is updated

    
    // If the user's score goes above the Target Score, the user loses.
        // Game is reset (via Function!)
        // Losses is increased by 1
    // If the user's score matches the Target Score, the user wins!!
        // Game is reset (via Function!)
        // Wins is increased by 1


    // RESET!! (This should all be wrapped in a Function)
        // New random Target Score is generated and assigned
        // New random Gem values are generated and assigned
        // Target Score on the screen is updated on the screen
        // User's Current Score is reset back to 0
        // User's Current Score is updated on the screen
